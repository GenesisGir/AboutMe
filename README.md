My name is Cristian and I grew up with computers my whole life and always had interests with the stuff!
I later found out that you can create your own programs and make them do whatever you want them to
so I started self teaching myself and now make the programs you see today! Im also a Twitch streamer
and stream my progress within them showing people my writing process which is like 20% AFk and 80%
coding and hardwork.
